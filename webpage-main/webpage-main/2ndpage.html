            <p>There are several species of hammerhead sharks, which are in the family Sphyrnidae. These species include the winghead, mallethead, scalloped hammerhead, scoophead, great hammerhead, and bonnethead sharks. Their oddly-shaped heads give them a wide visual range, which aids their hunting. These sharks inhabit tropical and warm temperate oceans around the world.</p>

                 Brownbanded bamboo sharks are known as "cat sharks" because the nasal barbels near their mouth look like cat     whiskers.
                 These are actually sensory organs that help them to locate food.
                 Juvenile sharks are marked with dark bands across the body and scattered dark spots.
                  Adults are light brown with very faint or no banding visible. These sharks have long slender bodies with two spineless dorsal fins of equal size.
                 They can grow to about three feet long.
